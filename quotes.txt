[23:18:17]  <@map>   the key tho for the wave is that everything feeds off each other.. i mean you can do it with topics that are unrelated but to me it's more of a 'sorting algorithm'
[23:18:20]  <@map>   basically
[23:18:36]  <@map>   you have all of this material (the math topics), and, your 'comparison' or 'order' is stuff you know or can learn
[23:18:39]  <@map>   so
[23:18:47]  <@map>   you just keep going through all of the topics, 'sorting' by what you are learning/know
[23:18:55]  <@map>   and you just keep making passes on it


[23:19:56]  <@map>   human memoization
[23:20:16]  <@map>   if we don't retain or build an intuition for something, then we are just less efficient in general
[23:20:24]  <@map>   and it may take us double or worse, the time to do something
[23:20:45]  <@map>   so finding ways to truly retain/build intuition is just like memoization/dynamic programming
